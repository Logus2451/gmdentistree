Key Insights
Database Structure : Uses Supabase with patients table containing fields like full_name, phone, email, age, gender, patient_code with clinic_id for multi-tenancy. Enhanced with hospital-clinic hierarchy where hospitals are parents of clinics

Prescription Grouping Strategy : Groups prescriptions by patient_id + prescribed_date to create multi-medication sessions without schema changes

User Workflow Preference : User prefers simplified UX with single unified forms rather than multiple options (removed single vs multi-medication distinction)

Clinical Notes Structure : Replaced single notes field with three separate fields: Observations, Investigations, Diagnosis combined into prescription notes and displayed as separate boxes in view/print

Patient Code Generation : Implemented database trigger using clinic_code from clinics table for automatic sequential patient code generation (e.g., GMS0001, GMS0002)

UI Design Preference : User prefers compact layouts that fit everything on one page with smaller icons, reduced padding, and efficient use of screen space

Grid Layout Preference : User prefers grid-based layouts over list views for better visual organization (3x3 grid for patients, grouped cards for examinations)

Hospital-Clinic Architecture : Implemented multi-level structure where hospitals manage multiple clinics, with role-based access (hospital admins can switch clinics, staff restricted to assigned clinic)

Settings Module Requirements : User wanted staff management, treatment pricing per clinic, currency settings, hospital overview, and subscription management at hospital level
